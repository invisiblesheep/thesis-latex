\chapter{Introduction} \label{Introduction}

The field has ...

-- NLP HAS PROGRESSED IMMENSELY IN THE LAST DECADE --
-- APPLICATIONS OF IT ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE COMMON IN DIFFERENT AREAS, ONE OF THEM BEING HEALTH DATA --
-- TEXT CLASSIFICATION IS ONE SUCH A TASK THAT HAS MANY USES, THUS TRYING IT ON MEDICAL SHIT IS GUCCI --


Nowadays, huge deep neural networks dominate the field of automatic text classification.
Even though they post the best results, other methods exist as well and have been used for a long time.



Chapter 2 gives a definition of text classification, insight on some of the most influential classifiers in the field of text classification in the past and a quick overview of neural networks as well.
Chapter 3 outlines the current state of machine learning -based natural language processing by explaining the different parts of a machine learning pipeline such as preprocessing, training and fine-tuning, and relevant model architectures.
Chapter 4 describes the medical report classification problem, the available data and compute resources and chosen methods, and discusses the results gained from utilizing said methods.
Chapter 5 is a concluding chapter which gives an overview of the thesis and its results.
